# TNL-LBM

__TNL-LBM__ is an implementation of the __Lattice Boltzmann Method__ using the
[__Template Numerical Library__](https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/tnl).
This repository contains a general framework for writing LBM-based solvers and
a few simple examples that show how to adapt the code for a particular problem.

TNL-LBM is a high-performance lattice Boltzmann code for direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of turbulent flow. It was verified and validated on multiple
problems, see the publications in the [Citing](#citing) section. The main
features are:

- Modular architecture with pluggable components (collision operators,
  streaming patterns, boundary conditions, macroscopic quantities, etc).
    - [Cumulant collision operator][CuLBM] for D3Q27.
    - The [A-A pattern][A-A pattern] streaming scheme can be employed to
      significantly reduce memory consumption.
- Optimized data layout on uniform lattice based on the [NDArray][NDArray]
  data structure from TNL.
- Scalable distributed computing based on [CUDA-aware MPI][CUDA-aware MPI] and
  [DistributedNDArraySynchronizer][DistributedNDArraySynchronizer] from TNL.
    - Good parallel efficiency is ensured by overlapping computation and
      communication.

## Getting started

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

2. Clone the repository, making sure that Git submodules are initialized:

       git clone --recurse-submodules <this_repo_url>

   If you cloned the repository without the `--recurse-submodules` option,
   the submodules can be initialized subsequently:

       git submodule update --init --recursive

3. Install the necessary tools and dependencies:

    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system (version 3.24 or newer)
    - [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html) toolkit (version 11 or newer)
    - compatible host compiler (e.g. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or
      [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/))
    - [CUDA-aware][CUDA-aware MPI] MPI library – for distributed computing
      (tested with [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/))
    - [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) (available in most Linux distributions)
    - [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) (available in most Linux distributions)
    - [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/) – string formatting library

4. Configure the build using `cmake` in the root path of the Git repository:

       cmake -B build -S . <additional_configure_options...>

   This will use `build` in the current path as the build directory.
   The path for the `-S` option corresponds to the root path of the project.
   You may use additional options to configure the build:

   - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>` where `<type>` is one of `Debug`, `Release`,
     `RelWithDebInfo`
   - `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<arch>` – to build for a CUDA architecture
     other than "native"
   - `-DSYSTEM_TNL` – to use TNL installed on the system instead of the Git submodule

5. Build the targets using `cmake`:

       cmake --build build

6. Run the example solver and supply its command-line arguments (here `4`
   determines the size of the lattice):

       ./build/sim_NSE/sim_1 4

   Distributed simulations can be run using `mpirun`. For example, to use two
   subdomains:

       mpirun -np 2 ./build/sim_NSE/sim_1 4

For convenience, steps 4-6 can be performed by running a simple script. For
example, to build and run `sim_1` as in the previous example:

    ./sim_NSE/run sim_1 4

## Getting involved

The TNL project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. While most of the work for TNL
involves programming in principle, we value and encourage contributions even from people proficient
in other areas.

This section provides several areas where both new and experienced TNL users can contribute to the
project. Note that this is not an exhaustive list.

- Join the __code development__. Our [GitLab issues tracker][GitLab issues] collects ideas for
  new features, or you may bring your own.
- Help with __testing and reporting problems__. Testing is an integral part of agile software
  development which refines the code development. Constructive critique is always welcome.
- Contact us and __provide feedback__ on [GitLab][GitLab issues]. We are interested to know how
  and where you use TNL and the TNL-LBM module.
